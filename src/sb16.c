 * game found it and the DMA is broken".  These do: one counts every DSP
 * command byte the guest writes, the other every DSP reset it performs, which

 * They used to sit in NJ_V6_STOP's page at 0xa8000 at slots 924..1051, and
 * everything from slot 1024 up is 0xa9000 - which is the JIT's block-exit
 * ring.  The DMA and interrupt counters were therefore reading the JIT's
 * data, which is how "SB_read_DMA entered 1, dma_cmd issued 3, IRQs raised
 * 1" came to look like a plausible measurement of a card that had in fact
 * done something else entirely.  0xaa000 is empty and 128 slots is far more

/*
 * The diagnostic block lives in ordinary memory, not at a fixed address.
 *
 * This used to be a literal pointer to 0x110aa000, which is PSRAM on the

 * that address is plain RAM belonging to whatever happened to be allocated
 * there, so the twenty-nine accesses below were reading and - worse -
 * incrementing words inside someone else's data.
 *
 * Two of the reads decide how the card is configured:
 *
 *   s->ver = SB_DIAG[SB_DIAG_VER] ? ... : 0x0405;
 *   s->irq = SB_DIAG[SB_DIAG_IRQ_SEL] ? ... : irq;
 *
 * They exist so a debugger can force a version or an interrupt without
 * rebuilding.  Reading uninitialised memory, the second one produced a
 * thirty-two bit number for an interrupt line, i8259_set_irq() indexed
 * s->pics[irq >> 3] with it, and the board took a data abort on an address
 * about 4.7 GB up - which is what made every attempt to use the Sound
 * Blaster kill the machine outright.
 *
 * A zeroed array keeps both overrides working the way they were meant to:
 * zero means "not forced", so the constructor's own arguments win.
